## README

### Assignment Details
- **Due Date:** Monday, 13 October 2025 at 23:55 (Week 11)
- **Submission Type:** Group assignment (one submission per group)
- **Late Penalty:** 5% per working day or part thereof
- **Unit Contact:** etc2420.clayton-x@monash.edu

### Group Work Guidelines

#### Effective Strategies
1. **Communicate Early:** Organize meeting times and establish communication channels with your group members
2. **Recommended Approach:** 
   - Each member attempts all tasks individually first
   - Meet to share ideas and perspectives
   - Decide on best approaches collectively
   - Allow time to combine efforts and review final report
3. **Avoid:** Splitting tasks among individuals without collaboration - you'll miss valuable learning opportunities

#### Academic Integrity
- ✅ **Allowed:** Verbal discussions with classmates outside your group
- ✅ **Allowed:** Seeking clarifications on online forums
- ❌ **Not Allowed:** Sharing files or written notes between groups (treated as collusion)
- **Important:** All submissions must reflect the genuine work and efforts of your group members

### Submission Requirements

#### Format
- **File Type:** Quarto (.qmd) file that compiles to PDF
- **Structure:** Mini-report format with clear sections for each task
- **Content:** Combination of written text and R code output

#### Quality Standards
1. **Organization:**
   - Clear headings and section structure
   - Each task in its own section with sub-sections as needed
   - Logical flow and professional presentation

2. **Explanations Required:**
   - Technical component (statistical methods, code logic)
   - Non-technical component (interpretations for general audience)
   - All recommendations supported with evidence
   - Justification for analytical choices

3. **Plots and Visualizations:**
   - Properly labeled axes
   - Clear legends explaining visual elements
   - Professional formatting
   - Accompanied by explanatory text

4. **Code Requirements:**
   - All code chunks shown and evaluated
   - Output formatted to fit within page margins
   - Suppress inconsequential messages and warnings

#### Required Code Chunk Setup
Include this as the first code chunk in your Quarto file:

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE,
                      eval = TRUE, message = FALSE)
```

### Assignment Structure

This assignment consists of **5 main tasks**. Each task should be completed by all groups regardless of unit code.

#### Task Format Template
For each task, structure your response as follows:

```
## Task [Number]: [Task Title]

### Introduction/Overview
[Brief description of the task and approach]

### Technical Analysis
[Statistical methods, code, and technical details]

### Results
[Findings with supporting evidence]

### Interpretation
[Non-technical explanation of results]

### Conclusions/Recommendations
[Evidence-based conclusions]
```

### File Organization

Your submission should include:
1. **Main Report:** `assignment2_group[X].qmd` (Quarto source file)
2. **Rendered PDF:** `assignment2_group[X].pdf` (compiled output)
3. **README:** This file (optional but helpful for documentation)
4. **Data files:** Any required datasets (if not provided centrally)

### Tips for Success

✓ Start early and plan multiple group meetings  
✓ Test your code thoroughly and ensure it compiles  
✓ Proofread for clarity, grammar, and formatting  
✓ Verify all plots are clearly labeled and explained  
✓ Ensure page formatting is correct (no text running off pages)  
✓ Balance technical rigor with clear communication  
✓ Support all claims with evidence from your analysis  
✓ Review the marking rubric carefully  

### Extension Requests

Extensions are only granted in exceptional circumstances for group assignments. If your **entire group** requires an extension:
- Email: etc2420.clayton-x@monash.edu
- CC all group members
- Provide a convincing case considering group circumstances
- Submit request before the deadline

### Questions or Clarifications

For assignment clarification questions:
- Post on the unit discussion forum
- Keep questions focused on understanding instructions/tasks
- Avoid sharing solution approaches publicly
