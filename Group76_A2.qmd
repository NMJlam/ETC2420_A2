# Task 2: \[20 marks\]

## Introduction

The task is to calculate the 90th percentile of the amount of traffic in each of the crossings (Southern Cross, Flinder's Street, QV Melbourne)

## Data Preparation

```{r task2-data-prep}
# Get each of the locations
qv_melbourne_traffic <- pedestrians[["qv_melbourne"]]
southern_cross_traffic <- pedestrians[["southern_cross"]]
flinders_street_traffic <- pedestrians[["flinders_street"]]
```

### Technical Approach

**Approach 1: Sample (Empirical) Quantile Method**

This involves bootstrapping, where many re-samples of the original data are created (with replacement) to emulate the variability we would see if we could repeatedly sample from the real population.

For each bootstrap sample, we calculate the 90th percentileâ€”the value below which 90% of the observations in that specific sample fall. We repeat this process thousands of times, accumulating all of these 90th percentile values to create a distribution of the 90th percentile estimator.

We then find the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of this bootstrap distribution to construct a 95% confidence interval. This interval provides our estimate of the true population 90th percentile with 95% confidence, allowing us to determine the traffic level that each crossing must accommodate to ensure smooth pedestrian flow 90% of the time.

```{r task2-analysis}
# Approach 1: Sample (Empirical) Quantile Method
find_90th_percentile <- function(data, trials = 5000) {
  # Ensure data is a numeric vector
  if (!is.numeric(data)) {
    stop("Input must be a numeric vector.")
  }
  
  # Remove missing values
  x <- data[!is.na(data)]
  n <- length(x)
  if (n == 0) stop("No data points available after removing NA.")
  
  # Bootstrap resamples
  q_boot <- replicate(trials, {
    xb <- sample(x, size = n, replace = TRUE)
    as.numeric(quantile(xb, probs = 0.9, type = 7))
  })
  
  # 95% CI from bootstrap distribution
  ci <- quantile(q_boot, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
  
  result <- list(
    ci_lower = unname(ci[1]),
    ci_upper = unname(ci[2])
  )
  
  return(result)
}
```

**Approach 2: Model Based Quantile**

southern_estimate_bootstrap <- find_90th_percentile(southern_cross_traffic)
